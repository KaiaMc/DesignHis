            <h2 id="ars">The production of Ars Moriendi used the woodblock printing method, which began to pick up in popularity during the ongoing search for printing methods that would make books easier to reproduce. This search for better printing technologies would set up well for the renaissance period to follow, laying the foundation for the future of print technology today!</h2>

            <h2>Casper of Regensburg, My Heart Doth Smart</h2>
            <p id="secthree">Unlike many other graphic images at the time, this piece does not hold any religious meaning. It is, in fact, a comical piece! The surrounding images depict a heart being broken in many silly ways, such as being sawed in half or burned at a campfire, as this man laments to his lover about his tormented soul.</p>

            <h3>With the invention of the printing press and movable type, we see massive progress from both the ways of Ars Mordeni and the start of modern printing practices! Production itself has too evolved, favoring a modular approach now that the technology could achieve it. Along with this, mass production was now a viable option, allowing for graphics and texts to be distributed on an unprecedented scale, for the time. Finally, we also see print technology begin to pick up, as the entertainment value of print begins to be recognized</h3>

            <h1 id="header-three">INDUSTRIAL PRACTICES SAW MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS</h1>
            <p id="first">Due to the plague, the “factors of production” (being labor, land, and capital), completely shifted. Costs of living dropped overall, meaning that civilians had more money to spend freely, boosting local economies. Land and capital costs dropped and became more abundant, and overall the perfect storm came for major industrial improvements.</p>
            <p id="second">Because of the high amount of capital, new technological advancement could be created, such as the printing press and movable type, highly useful and impactful tools that would shape the spread of print materials. More and more publishers were able to use these materials as they became more available during this time, revolutionizing the industry.</p>

            <h2 id="h2-seven">Oldbuck, Rodolphe Töpffer</h2>
            <p id="p-seven">Oldbuck is a hard graphic novel to pin an exact date on, as the original was released in 1837, but several extremely popular (and notably unlicensed) English-language versions were published around the 1840’s. It is commonly referred to as the “First Graphic Novel”, and follows the protagonist Mr. Vieux Bois as he attempts to court a beautiful young woman, who is seemingly unnamed.  </p>

            <h1 id="header-four">INDUSTRIAL</h1>
            <h3 id="oldbuck">While the printing press was in full-swing at the time of Oldbuck’s publication, due to Töpffer's original intention of having this book be shared only amongst his closest friends, the original books were printed using a lithograph. However, it is highly likely that the following prints done in the U.S. were done with a standard printing press. But, it is to be noted that the original plates that Töpffer used to print his books were shipped over to New York City in 1842, pointing to the industrial advancements made in the century prior that allowed for such prolific trade.</h3>

            <p id="p-eight">Previously regarded as the first graphic novel before the discovery of Oldbuck, The Yellow Kid follows Mickey Dugan (or, “The Yellow Kid”) around 19th-century New York City slums, getting into mischief with his group of friends. The comic was featured in many places, and is credited as coining the phrase “yellow journalism.”</p>

            <h1 id="header-eleven">INDUSTRIAL</h1>
            <h3 id="yellow">With the invention of the two-color lithography process patented by Godefroy Engelmann, colored printing began to become easier to print and produce. This caused all types of print media, such as package design, advertising, and magazines/newspapers, to slowly begin adopting color into their designs. 
                Just 2 years before the release of The Yellow Kid, illustrator William Kurtz patented a color-separation technique that used cyan, magenta, and yellow plates to create a wide array of colors. This would later become the CMYK color set in 1906.</h3>
