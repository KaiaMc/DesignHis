        <h1 id="usa">USA</h1>
        <h2 id="intro">Arguably the most important country in terms of the comic book/graphic novel industry,  much of the history surrounding this topic revolves around American artists, writers, and publishers. Because of this, to only talk about one or two series in depth would be doing the U.S. a great disservice, so let’s take a quick look at a bunch of American series!

        <h2 id="sincity"> Frank Miller’s Sin City </h2>
        <h4 id="sincity-desc">"'Sin City' is a series of neo-noir comics by American comic book writer-artist Frank Miller. The first story originally appeared in Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special (April 1991), and continued in Dark Horse Presents #51–62 from May 1991 to June 1992, under the title of Sin City, serialized in thirteen parts. Several other stories of variable lengths have followed. The intertwining stories, with frequently recurring characters, take place in Basin City.”
        </h4>
        <p id="sincity-thoughts">Sin City had an enormous impact on the medium, inspiring a darker approach to graphic novel storytelling and being the basis of the Sin City movies, a massive hit. The illustrations themselves are known for their challenging of the medium, such as through hiding onomatopoeias into the lighting of the scene.</p>

        <h2 id="Funnies"> Famous Funnies </h2>
        <h4 id="Funnies-desc">Based on the earlier series “The Funnies”, Famous Funnies were really just reprints of popular strips sold for 10 cents a pop, however it is considered influential as it is among the first of its kind, and commonly credited as the first “true” American comic book.</h4>

    <section class="super">
        <h2 id="super-title"> Superheros </h2>
        <h4 id="super-desc">How can one talk about comics without mentioning superheroes! The superhero, especially in the way we know of today, was created in the U.S. through comic books. Many consider FANTASTIC FOUR or AMAZING SPIDER-MAN to be the most influential superhero comic series, although Amazing Spider-man was more influential and popular at the time, solidifying what some call the “Stan-Lee” approach to comics.

        <h2 id="maus-title"> MAUS  </h2>
        <h4 id="maus-desc">Even among non-comic/graphic novel fans, Art Spiegelman's Maus is very well known for its storytelling and artistic choices. Many see Maus as a breakthrough of sorts, legitimizing graphic novels as a valid form of literary expression in the eyes of the public, being the only graphic novel to win the Pulitzer Prize.

    <section class="zap">
        <h2 id="zap-title"> ZAP COMICS </h2>
        <h4 id="zap-desc">ZAP comics is considered to be the first widely successful underground comic, creating a business for the genre and major publishing houses with distribution systems. Fabulously Furry Freak Brothers by Gilbert Shelton was ridiculously popular, outselling the previously mentioned Amazing Spiderman by quite a bit. Although a Supreme Court obscenity ruling shut down the underground comic market in 1973, the influence these edgy comics had on society incentivised other comic publishers to push the boundaries of their own content.
