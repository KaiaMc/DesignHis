        <h1 id="title">The Adventures of Tintin</h1>
        <h2 id="text">Almost every comic-historian views The Adventures of Tintin as being the most influential comic series to come out of France, notable for its “ligne claire” artistic style and well-researched and executed plots with well-integrated moments of slapstick comedy. Its direct influence on Europe can still be seen today, with Tintin being seen near constantly in murals on storefronts and apartment buildings. 

            Tintin himself had a massive impact on popular culture and the world, with notable military general Charles de Gaulle calling him is only rival:
            
            “In the end, you know, my only international rival is Tintin! We are the small ones, who do not let themselves be had by the great ones.”
            
            Michael Farr "Hergé created a hero who embodied human qualities and virtues but no faults. The Adventures of Tintin mirror the past century while Tintin himself provides a beacon of excellence for the future."
