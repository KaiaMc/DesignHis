            <h2>Ars Moriendi (The Art of Dying)</h2>
            <p>This highly religious publication served as a manual for how to die well, which basically meant avoiding temptation and sin. Produced mainly in the Netherlands and Germany, many consider this to be the beginning of the Graphic Novel, as it depicts its message so well that the words accompanying the illustrations are almost unnecessary. As the first graphic novel it sets the bar high, relying on images alone to do the storytelling, and doing so effectively.</p>
