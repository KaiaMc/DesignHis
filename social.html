            <h2 id="ars">During medieval times the circulation of intellectual texts became an industry, and had many social and monetary benefits. As a king, for example, being able to assert your power through text and printed imagery was almost as important as through military might. Also, the Medieval period marked a rise in scholarship (that is, the pursuit of knowledge), and so creating and spreading works such as these contributed to the knowledge “pool”, setting up for the renaissance period soon after.
                Also, Visual imagery and graphic language began to pick up in popularity along side the written word, fostering the environment for a piece that can express its meaning with its images alone

            <h2>Casper of Regensburg, My Heart Doth Smart</h2>
            <p id="secthree">Unlike many other graphic images at the time, this piece does not hold any religious meaning. It is, in fact, a comical piece! The surrounding images depict a heart being broken in many silly ways, such as being sawed in half or burned at a campfire, as this man laments to his lover about his tormented soul.</p>

            <h3>Around this time, we begin to see a movement towards more humanistic ways of thinking, a stark contrast from the religious and moral tones of the recent past. A new “urban culture” began to arise, making room for this approach with the new cities of a new Europe in the renaissance era. Martin Luther's 99 thesis, all printed out and stapled on the church doors, took place just 30 years later, a rise in secular studies emerged, and the non-religious values we see in My Heart Doth Smart begin to become more common socially. </h3>

            <h1 id="header-three">SOCIAL ATTITUDES CHANGED DRAMATICALLY</h1>
            <p id="first">Due to the plague, the amount of people in European cities dropped dramatically, unintentionally allowing for the cost of basic goods to drop. This gave people more economic freedom, allowing them to purchase manufactured products and benefit the local urban economy.

            <div class="photo4"><img src="agdge.webp"></div>
            <p id="second">The plague also caused a move towards a philosophy of empiricism, or the belief that your current observable reality is all that is true, as opposed to nominalism being focused on the abstract and fantastical. This mostly meant a shift from relying on religion and religious principles to guide your everyday actions to relying on your current observations to inform your decisions.
            </p>
            <p id="third">During this time, we also see a rise in the political cartoon, developing some techniques that later comics and graphic novels adopt, such as speech bubbles and callouts.

            <h2 id="h2-seven">Oldbuck, Rodolphe Töpffer</h2>
            <p id="p-seven">Oldbuck is a hard graphic novel to pin an exact date on, as the original was released in 1837, but several extremely popular (and notably unlicensed) English-language versions were published around the 1840’s. It is commonly referred to as the “First Graphic Novel”, and follows the protagonist Mr. Vieux Bois as he attempts to court a beautiful young woman, who is seemingly unnamed.  </p>

            <h3 id="oldbuck">As print media became more and more popular, graphic novels such as Oldbuck became more popular. Noticeably the Industrial Revolution occurred during the mid 19th century, drastically improving the lives of those in the middle class and higher. This would allow for more recreational time than before, allowing for these graphic novels to be read and enjoyed by larger audiences. The Victorian era also saw the rise in department stores, generally higher wages for those in the middle-class, and increased amounts of graphic design for advertising purposes. This led to a change in the way people shopped, potentially feeding into the success of graphic novels at the time.</h3>

            <h2 id="h2-eight">The Yellow Kid, Richard F. Outcault</h2>
            <p id="p-eight">Previously regarded as the first graphic novel before the discovery of Oldbuck, The Yellow Kid follows Mickey Dugan (or, “The Yellow Kid”) around 19th-century New York City slums, getting into mischief with his group of friends. The comic was featured in many places, and is credited as coining the phrase “yellow journalism.”</p>

            <h1 id="header-eleven">SOCIAL</h1>
            <h3 id="yellow">The Yellow Kid lived in the urban slums of NYC, which were incredibly common at the time period, as the rapid industrialization of society paired with the increased immigration into the U.S. prevented cities from being able to keep up with the growing population. Cities as a whole were generally viewed negatively as well, a place of crime and uncleanliness. The Yellow Kid echoed this time in society, much like how most entertainment pieces that are made for the general public tend to comment on the state of society at that time. </h3>
