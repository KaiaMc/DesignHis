        <h1 id="ussr">USSR</h1>
        <h2 id="intro">Comic books and graphic novels were not (and still are,actually) seen as low-brow entertainment. During the existence of the USSR, many saw comics as a form of capitalist propaganda, and a way that the U.S. government tried to poison the minds of russian citizens. However, that did not stop the production of underground comics or the explosion of the industry following the collapse of the USSR.

        <h2 id="Octobriana"> Octobriana </h2>
        <h4 id="Octobriana-desc">The origins of Octobriana are highly contested, however she was apparently created around the 1960’s with the publication of “Octobriana and the Russian Underground” by Petr Sadecky. Octobriana was created as an open-source superhero, meaning that she could be used in any publication of any kind by any person who wanted to. Sadecky claimed that Octobriana was created by the Peoples' Pornography Party (PPP), however some claim that her name oringinally was Amazona (although this could be false, as the only evidence pointing to such could be attributed to a simple punctuation error,) and was created by Bohumil Konecny, Sdneck Burian, and Milos Novak for Petr Sadecky.

        <h2 id="KOM"> KOM </h2>
        <h4 id="KOM-desc">Once Michel Gorbechev assumed power in 1985, his radical policy of Glasnost allowed for freedom of expression in the media, positive to the party or not. This freed artists and creatives, along with allowing for the comics industry to make its first entrance into Russian popular culture. Vecherniaia Moskva, a popular local russian newspaper of the time, was the first to introduce comics into the society, founding a “Komiks Klub '' of artists who created comics for the newspaper. 

            KOM material itself began appearing in Vecherniaia Moskva around 1988, often taking advantage of the Glasnost ideals to publish comics with more controversial, problematic, and racy topics. The reception of this was mixed, with younger readers having more positive receptions to this media than the older. The older generation was quite upset, sending letters to Vecherniaia Moskva venting their frustrations of the publication sheltering “alien socialist realism” and indulging in “‘Americanism”
